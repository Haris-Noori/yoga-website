                <h3>Ying Yang Fusion</h3>
                <p>The spine is designed for both mobility and stability, and often, we can have too much of one and not enough of the other. For optimal daily functioning, to live a fully functional life, we need a certain degree of mobility: enough to look behind us while backing up a car, to look both ways before crossing a street, to get down to and up from the floor, or out of a bathtub, to tie our shoes or to play our chosen sports. We also need enough stability to lift and carry objects or and children without risk of injury.</p>

                <p>Is deep relaxation calling your name? Sometimes it can be challenging to hit pause and rest.

These brief meditations will help you tap into those inner resources in less than 11 minutes. Each one follows a similar formula where you can expect a short centering practice to help your body and mind settle, followed by sensory observations, body scans, breath awareness, and visualizations.</p>
